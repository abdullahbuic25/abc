<p>We provide access to the Sites to you and the general public on a limited basis. You acknowledge that we have no special relationship or fiduciary duty to you.</p>

<p><b>THE SITES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED ABOVE, THE SITES ARE PROVIDED WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. THESE INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES IMPLIED BY ANY COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE, ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED.</b></p>

<p><b>IN CERTAIN STATES, LIMITATIONS ON CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE DURATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES MAY NOT BE ALLOWED BY LAW. IF SUCH LAWS APPLY, YOU AGREE THAT OUR LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE LOWEST LIABILITY ALLOWED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.</b></p>

<p><b>Electronic Communications Privacy Act Notice (18 USC 2701-2711): WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THE CONFIDENTIALITY OR PRIVACY OF ANY COMMUNICATION OR INFORMATION TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE SITES OR ANY LINKED WEBSITES. We will not be held responsible for the privacy of email addresses, registration and identification information, disk space, communications, confidential or trade-secret information, or any other user content stored on our equipment, transmitted over networks accessed by the Site, or otherwise associated with your Site usage.</b></p>

<p><b>(2) Your Indemnification Obligation:</b></p>
<p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us, our affiliates, and all employees, agents, members, partners, contractors, directors, suppliers, and representatives harmless from any liabilities, claims, and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, arising from or related to your violation of these Terms.</p>

<p><b>(3) Waiver and Release:</b></p>
<p>By using the Sites, you hereby waive and release, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all claims against us, our parent companies, subsidiaries, or affiliated entities, as well as their respective officers, directors, members, employees, consultants, contract employees, representatives, and agents, including their successors and assigns. This waiver encompasses any claims, actions, suits, procedures, costs, expenses, damages, and liabilities of any kind that may arise directly or indirectly from your use of the Sites.</p>

<p><b>You hereby release and forever discharge Terapage Limited and our officers, employees, agents, successors, and assigns from, 
    and hereby waive and relinquish, each and every past, present and future dispute, claim, controversy, demand, right, obligation, 
    liability, action and cause of action of every kind and nature, that has arisen or arises directly or indirectly out of, or that 
    relates directly or indirectly to, the Site. If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California civil code section 1542 in 
    connection with the foregoing, which states: “a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or 
    suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially 
    affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”</b></p>

<p><b>(4) Limitation of Liability:</b></p>
    <p>We shall not be held liable under any circumstances, whether in contract, tort, strict liability, negligence, or any other legal or equitable theory, for any kind of special, indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages, including lost profits, data loss, or damages arising from bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or similar sources. Our liability for any direct damages shall not exceed one-hundred GBP dollars (£100.00) in any situation.</p>

    <p>The limitations on our liability stated above apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, regardless of whether we have been advised of the possibility of such losses.</p>

<p><b>(5) Statute of Limitations:</b></p>
    <p>Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, any cause of action related to these Terms or the Sites must be initiated within one (1) year after the cause of action arises. Otherwise, the cause of action is permanently barred.</p>

<p><b>(6) Choice of Law and Venue:</b></p>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the United Kingdom, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. 
        You agree that any claim or dispute against us must be resolved in a court located in the United Kingdom, 
        unless otherwise agreed by the parties. You consent to the personal jurisdiction of the courts in 
        United Kingdom, for the purpose of litigating any such claims or disputes.</p><br>

<p><b>X. Subscriptions, Payments, and Charges:</b></p>

<p><b>(1) Services and Fees:</b></p>
    <p>The Sites may offer you the opportunity to purchase projects or subscriptions for accessing and using specific SaaS-based Services ("Services") in exchange for payments. The applicable fees and services are described on the Sites or in other service documentation provided by us.</p>

<p><b>(2) Services - Terms:</b></p>
    <p>If you choose to purchase Services, the effective date of your purchase will be the date you complete your registration on the Sites or when your account is activated by us and we receive a purchase order or initial payment.</p>

    <p>For subscription-based or time-based services, the service period ends on the last day of the subscription period or the last day of services, as indicated on the Sites or other documentation. After the service period ends, we may provide notice that your subscription period has expired, and you should download any content generated during your use of the Sites. After 90 days from such notice, we may terminate applicable services, delete your account(s), and all associated information. We have no obligation to archive, retrieve, or transmit any Site or account-related information after termination, unless otherwise agreed.</p>

<p><b>(3) Payment Processing:</b></p>
    <p>The Sites may require you to make payments for Site usage or product purchases. We have engaged third-party service providers to process credit card payments and other types of payments. Only the payment methods listed on the Sites are accepted. We do not have direct access to credit card numbers or other payment information, and our access to such information is limited to what is described in the Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><b>(4) Your Agreement on Payment Processing:</b></p>
    <p>By using a credit card for payment on the Sites, you agree that we (or our third-party service provider) may process charges for transactions initiated by you based on the fees and rates specified on the Sites.</p>

<p><b>(5) Additional Obligations/Restrictions:</b></p>
    <p>A. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold us harmless from any breach by you of credit or debit card processing agreements or agreements with alternative payment service providers (e.g., PayPal).</p>
    <p>B. Sharing accounts or creating multiple user accounts or connections to evade payment obligations is prohibited.</p>
    <p>C. We will charge you for purchased resources and services as indicated on the Sites or agreed upon in writing. Late payments may accrue interest at a rate of 1.5% per month or the highest rate permitted by law. We reserve the right to suspend or cancel transactions and related Site privileges for late payments. You are responsible for reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred in collecting late payments.</p>
    <p>D. You are responsible for paying all applicable taxes and government charges related to your Site payments. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to Site-related charges unless claimed within 60 days after the due date of the charge.</p>
    <p>E. You acknowledge and agree that we may share your credit card information, payment service information, and related billing and payment information with third-party service providers (e.g., payment processors, credit agencies) for credit checks, payment processing, and account servicing purposes. We may disclose such information in response to valid legal processes or to exercise our legal rights. We are not liable for any use or disclosure of such information by third parties.</p><br>

<p><b>XI. General Provisions:</b></p>

<p><b>(1) Integration and Severability:</b></p>
    <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, it will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary for the Terms to remain in full force and effect. The failure to exercise any right provided in these Terms does not constitute a waiver of further rights.</p>

<p><b>(2) Additional Terms:</b></p>
    <p>We are not liable for any failure to perform obligations resulting from causes beyond our reasonable control, such as mechanical, electronic, or communication failures. These Terms are personal to you and may not be assigned, transferred, or sublicensed by you without our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer, or delegate our rights and obligations without your consent. These Terms do not create an agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship between the parties. The prevailing party in any action to enforce these Terms is entitled to recover costs and attorney's fees. All notices under these Terms must be in writing and will be deemed given when received, electronically confirmed, or sent for next-day delivery by recognized overnight service. No third-party action or statement will amend these Terms. In case of inconsistencies, these Terms of Service govern. Headings are for convenience and do not limit or affect any provisions.</p><br>
